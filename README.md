# Mobile Applications Lab 3

## Project Description

### Introduction
Mobile Applications Lab 3 is an Android application developed in Android Studio using Java. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a seamless experience of logging in and entering their personal details, social media usernames, and displaying the information along with an option to navigate to their social media profiles.

### Features
The application consists of four activities:

1. **Login Activity**: This activity serves as the entry point for the users. Users are required to enter their username and password to proceed further into the application.

2. **Personal Details Activity**: Once logged in successfully, users are directed to this activity, where they are prompted to enter their register number, email address, and class name.

3. **Social Media Activity**: After entering their personal details, users are directed to this activity. Here, they are asked to provide their social media usernames for platforms like Instagram, Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

4. **User Profile Activity**: Upon completion of the previous activities, users are taken to this final activity. It displays the user's image, along with all the details previously provided. The activity also features a bottom toolbar with four social media icons corresponding to Instagram, Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn. Clicking on any of these icons will open the respective social media website and automatically navigate to the user's profile.

### Development Tools
The following tools and technologies were used in the development of Mobile Applications Lab 3:

- Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development.
- Java: The programming language used for developing the application's backend logic.
- XML: The markup language used for designing the application's user interface.

### Implementation Steps
The implementation of Mobile Applications Lab 3 involved the following steps:

1. Setting up the project in Android Studio.
2. Designing the login page layout using XML.
3. Implementing the login functionality, including username and password validation.
4. Designing the personal details page layout using XML.
5. Implementing the logic to store and retrieve the entered personal details.
6. Designing the social media page layout using XML.
7. Implementing the logic to store and retrieve the entered social media usernames.
8. Designing the user profile page layout using XML.
9. Implementing the logic to display the user's image and all previously entered details.
10. Adding the bottom toolbar with social media icons and implementing their click functionality.

### Conclusion
Mobile Applications Lab 3 is a comprehensive Android application that allows users to log in, enter their personal details and social media usernames, and view their profile information. The application provides a convenient way for users to navigate to their social media profiles directly from the app. By leveraging the power of Android Studio, Java, and XML, the application delivers a seamless user experience.
